"There are many ways to read comic books, and one of those that has become "
"more common in recent years is on a computer. Peruse was created as a way to "
"make exactly that as easy and pleasant as possible, and to simply get out of "
"the way and let you read your comic books. One could say that it allows you "
"to peruse your comic books at your leisure, but that would be a silly way of "
"putting it - so, peruse your comic books at your leisure!"

"One of the ways in which Peruse ensures your reading experience is as "
"pleasant and effortless as possible is to allow you to simply pick up where "
"you last left off. The welcome page in the application (first screenshot "
"below) shows you your most recently read comics, and shows your progress "
"through them. To pick up where you left off, simply tap the top left item "
"and you will be taken right to the page you were reading before you had to "
"stop."
