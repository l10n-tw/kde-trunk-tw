"Communication and collaboration within large groups and spread over several "
"time zones is complex and something of the norm in modern projects and the "
"existing solutions available are not up to that challenge. Kube is a way to "
"simplify and make communication elegant again by focusing on the key needs "
"of users instead of filling it with any feature that comes to mind. Our "
"strict focus on what is actually needed instead of what is wanted brings a "
"new way of collaboration between group members and a simpler way of handling "
"communication."
